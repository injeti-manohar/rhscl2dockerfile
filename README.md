[outdated] rhscl2dockerfile
===========================

:exclamation: **Outdated Notice**

Simple script to generate Software collections Dockerfiles

The Dockerfiles were intended as examples which can be used to build
more complex containers.

However, over the time some more mature containers were developed and are now maintained in separate repositories under https://github.com/sclorg. Please, find particular repository there instead. For listing all containers under that organization, see https://github.com/sclorg?q=-container.
